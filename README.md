# MedChain
Blockchain based medical reports monitoring system (EHR)
● Implementation of the blockchain network where each node comprises the medical reports of the patient. The blockchain
network is to be implemented along with cryptographic hash.
● Transmission of the records to the patient using encryption. Encryption is involved which makes the network more secure and
robust.
● Granting access to the doctor for accessing the reports of the patient. Access must be given to the doctor so that they can
access the records and carry out medical diagnosis.
● Creation of a suitable user interface for doctors to monitor the reports. A user interface is to be provided which would be user
friendly and various operations can be carried out without any hassle.
● Link creation and transmission for secure and timely access of the reports. A link is to be created and secure transmission is to
be carried out and timely access must also be imposed.
